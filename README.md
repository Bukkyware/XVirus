1. **Advanced TLS Integration:** Xvirus utilizes tls_client to establish secure connections, because, you know, security is essential, even when you're being cheeky.

2. **Proxy Shenanigans:** When combined with proxies, Xvirus takes your privacy to another level, making it nearly impossible for anyone to trace your digital footsteps. Not that we're encouraging mischief, of course, wink wink.

3. **Diverse Module Set:** Xvirus features a range of modules, each designed to expand your capabilities within Discord's API while maintaining a low profile, or at least trying to.

4. **User Friendly Design:** We've gone out of our way to make Xvirus user friendly, because even rebels need an easy to use tool. It's all part of the disguise.

5. **Compliance and Ethics:** While we playfully push the boundaries, we always aim to remain within the limits set by Discord's guidelines, fostering responsible and ethical use. Or at least we pretend to.

6. **Regular Updates:** Here's the twist, the paid version of Xvirus gets the full royal treatment with regular updates, unlocking even more powerful features and capabilities. It's like the VIP experience for digital exploiters. But don't worry, we still do our best to update the free version, even if it's not quite as powerful. We like to spread the love, even to the rebels on a budget.

Xvirus isn't about grandiose claims of being a masterpiece, it's a simple tool designed to provide a secure and discreet gateway into Discord's API, all while "maintaining a facade of legality and TOS friendliness".
